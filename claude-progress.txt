## Architecture

- Python orchestrator: FastAPI + LangGraph (ingestion DAG + query DAG)
- Go ingestion workers: Kafka consumer, dispatcher, forwarding processor, DLQ
- Neo4j 5.26: Knowledge graph with 5 constraints, 3 indexes, fulltext search
- Apache Kafka 3.9: KRaft mode, at-least-once delivery
- OpenTelemetry: Distributed tracing across Go -> HTTP -> Python boundary
- Prometheus: Consumer lag, batch duration, DLQ rate, jobs processed metrics

## Quality Gates

All gates pass before every push:
1. Pylint: 10/10
2. Python tests: all passing
3. Go tests: all passing
